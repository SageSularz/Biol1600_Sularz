# Jan 14

always annotate your code - extensively! first script to illustrate basics

## Commands

git pull

git add -A (stage files that have been changed)

-   -A (all) find alt for finer selection

git commit -am 'message'

## Notes

Grammar for commit message -\> present tense, active verb, no punctuation

# Jan 21

## Markdown

.Rmd \>\> *knit* \>\> .md \>\> *pandoc* \>\> html *or* pdf *or* doc

-   can only go one way

## Git Account Navigation

**View current configuration**

git config --list

**Update Author:**

-   Globally\
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"\
    git config --global user.email "[your.email\@example.com](mailto:your.email@example.com){.email}"

-   Locally (this repo only)\
    git config user.name "Your Name"\
    git config user.email "[your.email\@example.com](mailto:your.email@example.com){.email}"

**Fix author on previous commits:**

git commit --amend --author="Your Name \<your.email\@example.com\>"

## Creating a new webpage

**console**

rmarkdown:::site_skeleton(getwd())

-   created new files- (\_site.yml) (about.Rmd) (index.Rmd)

.yml file

-   very sensitive to syntax

-   structure and spacing very important

add.."output_dir:docs"

use mit license

# Jan 23

Latex

-   Rstudio

-   Beamer

    -   presentation but it can be a pain see fake beamer to use with pp

    -   download to use all the resources

-   .Swr

-   Overleaf

-   Inkscape

    -   full open source to integrate with R for creating images

## BBeditor

use for editing txt files

grep (reg expressions check)

**Wildcards**

-   `\w` a single word character [letter,number or `_`]

-   `\d` a single number character [0-9]

-   `\t` a single tab space

-   `\s` a single space, tab, or line break

-   `\n` a single line break (or try `\r`)

**Quantifiers**

-   add these on to any of the wildcards

-   `\w+` one or more consecutive word characters

-   `\w*` zero or more consecutive word characters

-   `\w{3}` exactly 3 consecutive word characters

-   `\w{3,}` 3 or more consecutive word characters

-   `\w{3,5}` 3, 4, or 5 consecutive word characters

## R's four data types

+------------+---------------+------------+
|            | homoginous    | hetero     |
+============+===============+============+
| 1-D        | Atomic Vector | List       |
+------------+---------------+------------+
| 2-D        | Matrix        | Data Frame |
|            |               |            |
|            |               | vectors    |
+------------+---------------+------------+
| Multi- D   | array         |            |
+------------+---------------+------------+

Types of atomic vectors

-   charactor strings

-   intergers

-   double

-   integers , doubles are "numeric"

-   factor

    -   determine char strings w/ groupings

-   logical

    -   TRUE/FALSE

-   vector of lists

### Atomic Vectors

on class page

# Feb 4

## Wrapping up Vectors

AtomicVectors.R

## Matrices and Lists

Matrices_Lists.R

# Feb 6

## Matrices and Lists cont.

# Feb 11

meta data

-   used to be harder but with ai you can just type out what you want and include as much info as you can and it will be

Creating and saving files

-   rather than send all the code you used to create something just save your work as a new file

-   can only save one thing at a time but you can just bundle them together then save

Finish up with Matrices_lists.R

Check point

-   right now working with linear code

-   now learn different control structures to mange your script

-   aka functions

### Functions

best practices

-   get the header with the function name, discription, input, and output (like metadata for func)

-   names inside function can be short and basic

    -   function should be kept simple and just do its job

-   should be able to see on one screen if its longer should probs break into multiple

-   provide all default values for all functional aurguments

-   see example in Functions.R for good format and asthetics

working with your function

-   create function \>\> save function to R enviroment \>\>call it

-   objects are in short term memory- what happens in function stays in function

-   function should be completely self suffiecent and work anywhere

    -   not dependent on the enviroment of the user

    -   so important to include input in header so others know

-
