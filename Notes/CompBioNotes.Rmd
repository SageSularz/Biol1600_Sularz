## R's four data types

+------------+---------------+------------+
|            | homoginous    | hetero     |
+============+===============+============+
| 1-D        | Atomic Vector | List       |
+------------+---------------+------------+
| 2-D        | Matrix        | Data Frame |
|            |               |            |
|            |               | vectors    |
+------------+---------------+------------+
| Multi- D   | array         |            |
+------------+---------------+------------+

Types of atomic vectors

-   charactor strings

-   intergers

-   double

-   integers , doubles are "numeric"

-   factor

    -   determine char strings w/ groupings

-   logical

    -   TRUE/FALSE

-   vector of lists

# Jan 30

### Atomic Vectors

on class page

# Feb 4

## Wrapping up Vectors

AtomicVectors.R

## Matrices and Lists

Matrices_Lists.R

# Feb 6

## Matrices and Lists cont.

# Feb 11

meta data

-   used to be harder but with ai you can just type out what you want and include as much info as you can and it will be

Creating and saving files

-   rather than send all the code you used to create something just save your work as a new file

-   can only save one thing at a time but you can just bundle them together then save

Finish up with Matrices_lists.R

Check point

-   right now working with linear code

-   now learn different control structures to mange your script

-   aka functions

### Functions

best practices

-   get the header with the function name, discription, input, and output (like metadata for func)

-   names inside function can be short and basic

    -   function should be kept simple and just do its job

-   should be able to see on one screen if its longer should probs break into multiple

-   provide all default values for all functional aurguments

-   see example in Functions.R for good format and asthetics

working with your function

-   create function \>\> save function to R enviroment \>\>call it

-   objects are in short term memory- what happens in function stays in function

-   function should be completely self suffiecent and work anywhere

    -   not dependent on the enviroment of the user

    -   so important to include input in header so others know

-   

# Feb 13

*Functions.R*

### scoping

local variables

-   visable only with the function

-   can not call or use outside the function

Global variables

-   visable broadly in the R enviroment

### function notes

-   when running first looks for variables in local envrioment if it cant find it it looks in global

-   function should be focused on one task

fit_linear2

-   passing in a single list with vectors and contains if statement to determine if user is inputing variables

-   `NULL` represents the null object in **R**: it is a [reserved](http://127.0.0.1:19511/help/library/base/help/reserved) word. `NULL` is often returned by expressions and functions whose value is undefined.

Mean arguments

+----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| `trim`   | the fraction (0 to 0.5) of observations to be trimmed from each end of `x` before the mean is computed. Values of trim outside that range are taken as the nearest endpoint. |
+----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

-   cuts out the extreme outliers \^\^

+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| `na.rm`   | a logical evaluating to `TRUE` or `FALSE` indicating whether `NA` values should be stripped before the computation proceeds. |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

\####

`do.call` constructs and executes a function call from a name or a function and a list of arguments to be passed to it.

Why are functions important

-   functions break large tasks into smaller managable problems that can be linked together

### Control Structures

3 ways to use if statement

1.  `if (condition) {expression1}`

2.  `if (condition) {expression1} else {expression2}`

3.  

    ```         
    if (condition1) {expression1} else
      if (condition2) {expression2} else
    ```

think about bunddling into functions or user does not have to wade around your code

# Feb 18

Continuing with control structures...

Control structure = determine what is run in your code and what is not

### examples of generic structures

if TRUE

> block a
>
> expression
>
> block b

if FALSE

> \-

**More complex**

Block A

> if (condition) {expression} else {expression}

if TRUE

> block a
>
> expression
>
> block b

if FALSE

> block a
>
> expression 2
>
> block b

**Different structure**

> block A

> if (condition 1) {expression 1} else
>
> > if (condition 2) {expression 2} else
>
> block b

*condition 1 True*

*condition 2 false*

> block A

> expression 1
>
> block b

*condition 1 true*

*condition 2 true*

> block A
>
> expression 1
>
> block b

-   it doesnt matter what expression 2 is will get same if 1 is true

-   why? old computer shit

*condition 1 false*

*condition 2 false*

> block A
>
> block b

*condition 1 false*

*condition 2 true*

> block A
>
> expression 2
>
> block b

**More straight forward approach**

> block a
>
> if (condition 1) {expression 1}
>
> if (condition 2) {expression 2}

-   could put a naked else at the end and sometimes people do but the rest will run either way it is redundant

### ifelse

```         
ifelse(test,yes,no)

test is an object that can be coerced to a logical yes/no
yes return values for true elements of test
no return vales for false elements of test
```

## For Loops

isssues

-   can be slow (cbind, lists)

-   not always nessasary there are easier ways to do thing

-   many ops can be handled using `apply` functions

i , j, k

-   trad labels for var

-   best to stick to one so you reconize it

-   

# Feb 20

### for loops

can expand model in many ways

-   `round()`

-   exstiction of sexually reproducing pop

-   add envriomental noice that is not a random walk

-   add measurement error (add rnorm(0,1) for 0's wo exstiction

# Feb 25

### For loops

Issues with while loops

-   complex boolean statements

-   no idea if it will ever end, will just keep running in theory

expand.grid

-   create data frame from any type of vectors

# Feb 26

### Extended Lecture

### dplyr and SQL 

what is tidy verse

-   curated set of packages to help with data cleaning/wrangling/analysis

-   meant to be all inclusive from importing data all the way to communicating it

data import/managemnt

-   readr- import and read imported data

SQL : another option for interacting with large datasets

-   Structured Query Language (SQL)

dplyr : for data manipulation and structuring your dataframes

the core verbs used in dplyr

-   filter()

    -   picks/subset observations by their values

    -   uses `> , >=, <, <=, ==, !`

    -   filter automatically excluded NA, need to ask for them

-   arrange()

    -   reorder rows

-   select()

    -   choosing variables by their name

-   summarize() and group_by()

    -   collapse many values down to a single summary

    -   use group_by() for additional calcs

-   mutate()

    -   create new variables with functions of existing variables

to avoid a conflict between packages `dplyr : : filter()`

What is the difference between dplyr and base R?

-   pipe statements (or piping) `%>%`

    -   these are sequences of actions that will change your dataset by passing an intermediate result onto the next function in sequence

    -   you should avoid this when you need to manipulate more than one object at a time or if there are meaningful intermediate objects

    -   **Formatting:** should always have space before it and usally followed by new line

    -   Caution: these can be long sequences and if there is an error it will be a huge pain in the ass to find and resolve

## Strategic Coding WS

### The problem of scaling

physiological demand and supply

-   biological species cant just scale up size and still meet demand needs

    -   same applies to working with a script

-   need to take function pieces from different sources to scale up functionality

ex of scales problems

-   you have written a single script to open a single data file and analyze results for specific species. you have 50 species and 50 data files

-   over time you need to add 10 new data files. remove three other, and edit the contents of the og 12

symptoms of scaling problems

-   c&pasting many lines of code in single script

-   incosistant formatting and obscure object and file names

-   little or no annotation of code or data files

-   coppying, renaming, and editing entire script files

-   running model variations by using find and replace

-   copying number by hand from screen output

-   saving graphics through GUI interface

-   difficult to use code to do anything up the og task

-   eventual inability to fully reproduce on your own

Attributes of a wellscaled large project

-   well organized project folders with informative file and object names

-   extensive annotation of scripted and data files

-   most code in user defined functions (short, simple, limited input &output)

-   code can handle multiple input files through batch processing

-   use of RDS objects for conplex projects and collaborative coding

-   Holy grail: source("Scripts/MainScript.R")

## Working in R

install :

-   pracma

-   pryr

-   install_github("ngotelli/upscaler")

Organization

-   use subheaders in R script like you do in rmd

-   colapse sections of your code to keep organize

Snippets

-   set your own autofill templates

-   tools \> edit code snippets

-   you should pick your own flare for them (currently m.\_\_\_\_)

### folders

what is clean data?

-   data set that can be opened in R

<!-- -->

-   og data goes into "OriginalData" folder once edited at all it goes to "CleanData"

Scripts

FUnctions

Plots

-   any images created while coding

    -   jpegs, pdf, anything that was made to stare at

-   dont save images by using Rstudio GUI interface

    -   learn ggsave and similar

-   use letters, not numbers to name consecutive images or tables

    -   huge pain if you have to go back and rename them better to keep organized in publication format

outputs

-   only used to create and store summary .csv

DataObjects

```         
x <- runif(10) # object to save 
saveRDS(object = x,
        file = "DataObjects/x.rds") # save to disk
restored_x <- readRDS(file = "DataObjects/x.rds") # reopen to new name
```

-   good to share with out someone fucking with your stuff

-   only works in R

Markdown

-   good to share formated code with images in a nice way

-   

# Mar 25

## Strat. Coding

Ended last time talking about structuring your project...

RDS object

-   compressed R object (only used in R world)

-   saves time rerunning code or for sharing with others without them being able to edit you code

-   similar to load and save

    -   but those arent ideal cause they save the entire R enviroment and that is alot

### Log file

-   plain txt file that is generated in the R system

-   what to use for?

    -   to store the metadata about program/project

    -   to decorate the code (put in differnt label to what the program is doing)

    -   debugging (error in code and want to talk to program while it runs)

-   often used by IT folks who need to keep track of large systems

-   many differnt systems

    Changes in R

-   need to be able to look back and understand the enviroment a program was written in (R system, computer, libraries, ect)

`set_up_log()`

-   creates new txt file with info about current session

    -   date time user libraries etc

how to use?

-   same way you annotate code

    -   `l('load libraries')` vs. `# load libraries`

### Coding with User defined functions

`source()`

-   runs something else l ike functions and stuff

Quick side quest on types of type..

-   snake_case

-   camelCase

-   PascalCase

-   kabob-case

-   SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

-   snake case is most common but make sure to be intentional about what you use, it very often matters

Best practice for user defined functions

-   keep it simple if you have more than like 2-3 inputs its doing too much

    -   you dont need to make you and everyones life hard just make multiple smaller specific functions

    -   does one thing isolation

    -   shouldnt have to scroll -keep it short!

-   has a verb based discriptive title

-   dont fuck around with global variables

    -   not worth the problems either as an input or saveing to global env

    -   use default vals that user can sub for their own or random num generator

Functional programing

step 1) create sudo code

-   on a paper (just not console) and plan out what you need to do

-   Make an outline :)

-   take a large project and break it down into approachable bites

```         
EX: 
Project: Host dinner party 
Steps: 
select_recipes
write_shopping_list
buy_grocieries
cook_meal
serve_meal
clean_up
```

```         
build_function(c("select_recipes",
"write_shopping_list",
"buy_grocieries",
"cook_meal",
"serve_meal",
"clean_up"))
```

# Mar 27

Components of a function

O = object

-   RDS

S = script

F = function script

M = main script

I = input

-   csv, etc

P = product (output)

-   csv, tiffs, etc

there is not one "correct " way to write a program but there is general structual parts that are imporant

Main script

-   function

-   function

-   function

The main script is the hub the functions will run through

-   make sure functions function

-   this could be it if your project is simple enough

What shouldnt you do?

-   F -\> F

    -   a function shouldnt call another function

    -   rather F1 -\> O

-   S -\> S

    -   scripts shouldnt call eachother

    -   rather S1 -\> RDS

Common starting point: I -\> F -\> O

## ggplot

after leaving early last class I do not have access to the code we are building on in class today so just taking notes here and will fill in once notes are posted. I am peeved

okay for future reference

![Gotelli's GitHub](%5Bhttps://github.com/GotelliLab/Bio381https://github.com/GotelliLab/Bio381%5D(https://github.com/GotelliLab/Bio381)%7B.uri%7D)

Started to fill in from downloaded Rmd off his git but we are moving on to the next lecture

## ggplot II

### Plotting multiple panel graphs with `patchwork`

-   how do we combine all 4 plot types? Patchwork!

-   like working within gg use the + to add things on (or together)

    -   \+ plot_layout()

        -   change orientation

        -   change area each plot takes up

    -   \+ plot_spacer()

        -   create space in between plots

        -   maybe to add something else later or just for asthetics

    -   nested layers

        -   manipulate arrangement in a more complex way

-   operators

    -   -operator for subtrack placement
    -   / and \| for intuitive layouts
        -   `(g1 | g2 | g3)/g4` obvious what it will look like
        -   this is nice bc it just makes sense i think

-   annotation

    -   use patchwork to add captions titles and more

        -   like what you might do in basic ggplot but this seems nicer and all asethtic shit in one spot

    -   add letter names or other little labels to plots (v important!) use `plot_annotation()`

-   orientation

    -   `scale_x_reverse()`

    ```         
    -   mirror, flip and do whatever gymnastics with your plots
    ```

    -   `coord_flip()`

        -   rather than flipflopping on x/y access effect the actual coords

-   Saving

    -   save your shit!!

    -   use ggsave to be specific on format and specs

    -   below is a good example of common specs for publishing

```         
ggsave(filename="MyPlot.pdf"
       ,plot=g3, 
       device="pdf",
       width=20,
       height=20,
       units="cm",
       dpi=300)
```

-   Basic mapping of aesthetic variables

-   discrete variables

    -   start paying more attention to `geom_point()` and `aes()`

    -   map to color -\> aes(color = class)

    -   map to shape -\> aes(shape = class)

        -   ggplot is not a disign expert if you ask it to do something that looks like shit or is wrong it will do it

    -   map to size -\> aes(size = class)

        -   gg will rember what you did last and use that to follow future directions (no ai just whats in your enviroment)

        -   better for continuous variables

-   continuous

    -   map to size can be used for a bubble plot- looks nice could be useful

    -   map to color -\> makes almost a heat map

-   Multiple variables at once

    -   package more information into your visuals

# Apr 3

Faceting variables for more effective groupings

-   split by variable

-   this is this mini grid thing I was looking for!

    -   shows relationships between groups AND where the missing data is

-   ajusting axis scaling

    -   depends on where you want to draw readers attention and what point you want to make

-   `facet_wrap()`

    -   w 2 classifying labs

    -   doesnt include missing combinations

        -   use facet_grid or mod with m1 + facet_wrap(\~class + fl`, drop=FALSE)` to bring them back

-   facet with other aesthetic mapping within rows or columns

    -   same kind of graph but now its colored

-   changes to geom()

    -   if you have lots of data it may be too overwelming to put in all the raw data instead consiter geom_smooth

    -   basically a colored line reping a fitted regression line

    -   shows linear trends in data and x & y subsets better

-   what about other plot types?

    -   change geom\^\^\^\^

        -   `geom_point` vs `geom_smooth` vs `geom_boxplot` etc

        -   what visual strategy communicated your point best?

### Mapping aesthetics within geoms

color: maps to points or lines with no thickness

fill: fills space basically

-   you can totaly combine all this however you feel like

`geom_point(data=d[d$drv=="4",])`

-   only select sub data as specified

-   following normal sub setting rules within geom_point

-   this will override previous statements in the plot

## ggplot III

### Barplots

multiple groupings

-   use the fill to map to variables within each bar

-   `alpha` = opacity (0=transparent & 1=opaque)

tapply

-   wants to know x

-   and needs a grouping factor

-   passes name of function

### Boxplots

jitter: offsets points so you can see more of them

-   gives some perspective on sample size
